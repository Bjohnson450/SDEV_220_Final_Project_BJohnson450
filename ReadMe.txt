This program is designed to generate and organize text files with the names and locations of grocery items using Walmart as an example for how it structures it's shopping environment.

To run this program, open and run main_v2.0 in a code editor of your choice or through your terminal using: 
>C:\Your-Folder-Directory>python main_v2.0.py

Ignore main.py as that is the prototype build of the code originally made for this project and is both outdated and can only run in the terminal.

Once run a GUI will open with a drop down window at the top. Select what type of item you want from the list. Next, input any additional information related to the item in question in the empty fields (fat content for Dairy, item size, etc...). Once that is finished, input the Department name, the Aisle number, and a brief description of where the Shelf for the item is located. When all fields are filled, click the Add Item button to hold the added info for the soon to be generated text files. You can repeat this for as many items as you want. When you are finished, click the Save Items button to generate text files for all items you added (DO NOT CLOSE WINDOW UNTIL YOU HAVE SAVED ITEMS).

Files that have been saved will be located in the Item_locations folder.
